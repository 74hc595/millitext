# "Millitext" generator

In 2008 I made a little experiment called "Subpixel Text Encoding," a.k.a. [millitext](http://www.msarnoff.org/millitext/).

This is the source code for the [millitext generator](http://www.msarnoff.org/millitextgen/), which has been nonfunctional for quite some time.

This code was written for Ruby 1.8 and used RMagick. I am no longer a Ruby developer and do not have the bandwidth to bring it up to date or maintain this code. It is provided as-is (with no guarantees that it works) under the 3-clause BSD license.
